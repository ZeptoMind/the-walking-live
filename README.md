================

Count the amount of people attend to a public event in HK by using mobile devices.

So how we begin ?
I will start a repo on Github and allowing the public to see everything of what I did in the purpose of education. (link will be put on here later)

and What is the difficulty?
I need money to run the server.

and What is the real challenging of this app?
To handle large amount of real time user accessing information on the server. We are talking about 20K-100K within a short amount of period like 1 hour - 5 hours. (maybe less than that)

is it worth?
Yes. explanation will come if that hit the public.

what is the cost like?
Thats around a couple thousand dollars, it depends on how complicate that the app will look like.
In the mean time, we use GAE to handle peak traffic and therefore, the cost will not like a monthly subscription , instead it should be one off per event.

What is the target date?
1/1 (As i think there is a public event going on that day.)

Will I learn something in here?
Surely Yes!

Can I contribute?
yes. fork the repo or post question on here or wiki.  More on this very soon.

What is the requirement look like?
next post.

what is the targeting devices?
iphone, ipad, android phone, android pad, anything !
What I most focus on now is iOS and android first, everything will come if there are developer willing to contribute. Thanks!

Where the name come from?
The walking dead . LOL I mean it.
